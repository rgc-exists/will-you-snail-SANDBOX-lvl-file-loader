# Will You Snail SANDBOX .lvl file loader
A very basic and limited Will You Snail mod that allows you to load levels made in the level editor beta in the sandbox branch. This is meant to be built upon to make something better, as there isn't really much point by itself. (The sandbox branch is currently the only easily-accessible version of wys that can be modded.)
